CS-255 System Analysis and Design Portfolio of Work

•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project is the main project of CS-255 designed to teach the fundamentals of System Analysis and Design. For this project I am tasked by the client Liam who is the owner of DriverPass to design a system for their Driver Training classes. The type of system they wanted me to design is an online web-based system. It is essentially a website platform for students, teachers/trainers, and administrators of DriverPass to manage their information.

•	What did you do particularly well?

What I believe I did well on was the requirements gathering portion of the assignment and designing a system based on these requirements. The client did not have many specific requests other than access to the system data, administrative powers, and requirement for students to sign up for classes via phones. Therefore, I gave recommendations on maintenance, web services, databases, and different cloud-based companies they can use to store their data. I believe that the client should make the decision on who and what to use so they will be satisfied with their project.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

What I would choose to revise would be my sequence diagram. I want to add color coding, more labels and missing sequences.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

How I interpreted the user’s needs and implement them into my design was simply one phrase, which is “ease of use and access”. This means that the system should be easy to use and accessible on many different devices. Today most people have smart phones and prefer to do things on their smartphones. Therefore, I chose to design this system as a web-based application so that it can be accessed on any device that has internet. This way we don’t need to worry about designing an Operating System specific application.
It is important to consider the user’s needs when designing because if their needs aren’t met, they will not use your system/product. Therefore, it will be an ineffective product and a failure.

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach design by finding the goal or mission of the software, then go through the Software Development Life Cycle of gathering requirements. I think the techniques that I will use in the future if I have the resources will be to implement focus groups and surveys. It is important that you know your audience/users well before you design a product/system/software. The success of my design is based on the amount of people who use it, and if no one uses it then it fails regardless of how it is designed.
